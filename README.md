# Interactive Keyboard

Alright so, continuing on my journey to learn more coding I have figured out how 
to attach keyboard inputs to the icons on screen. And what I mean by that is simply
you press the button on the keyboard the corresponding icon lights up on the screen
and I am very happy I figured out how to pull this off.
